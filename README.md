# DLP-Test
I wanted to try DLP from python, as I am not a programmer as well I want to learn Python, I started off with different examples from the DLP pages at Google.
I struggled to get authentification working or finding my DLP project and not the default. On end I got it working the Alpha Library Version of the DLP API version for python. Here you see the Library: https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/dlp/index.html .
Here is the crucial documentation for the Library: https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/google-cloud-python/latest/google-cloud-python.pdf.
Key create :JSON File for the service at  gcloud console : API & Dienste -> Zugangsdaten -> Anmeldedaten erstellen, this download the JSON File .
